This is my PhD project that deals with mining spatio-temporal RDF data.
Heterogeneous data from a relational database or in tabular form are first transformed to RDF and then loaded into Strabon. 
Finally, mining algorithms can be used to discover new knowledge from the triple store (a.k.a. the knowledge base).
